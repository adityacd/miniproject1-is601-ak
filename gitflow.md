## Understanding the Gitflow


1. Repository
* A repository is like a folder for your project.
* Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history.
* You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

2. Clone
* Clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location.
* The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote machine accessible supported protocols.
* git clone is used.

3. Fork  
* It is used to access the contents of the owner repository.


4. Branch
* A branch is a reference to a commit. 
* The branch represents the top of a series of commits.


5. Commit

* It captures the snapshot of the currently made changes in git. 

6. Merge
* It is used to merge the work from different branches to the master branch. 

7. Checkout
* The checkout is used in git to select a branch in a repository. 
* Branching helps to organize work.
* The branches can be merged toghether.


8. Push
* The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
* Pushing is how you transfer commits from local to remote repo.

9. Pull
* The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository.
* It immediately update the local repository to match that content.

10. Remote Add/Remove/Show


11. Status
* The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
* It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.

12. Master Branch
* A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits.
* The default branch name in Git is **master**.
* As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.
* Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.
