**'Aditya Deshmukh' (acd53)** and **'Karan Kaul'(kk629)** for (IS601) **Web Systems Development** course taught by **Prof. Keith Williams.**



## This guide will help you to understand the basics of **Filesystems** and **Gitflow**.


 How using **Github, Docker, Automated testing** and **Continuous Integration** can help improve productivity:

1. Using all of the above help in increasing the efficiency and scalability of the system.
2. They all help make the system more organised and systematic which makes surfing through the system much more easier.
3. Github being open source helps people track changes, view progress of ones software development.
4. Github allows collaboration amongst people sitting across different locations.
5. Docker helps in continPuous integration efficiency, compatibility,maintainability,continuous deployment and testing.
6. Automated testing provides faster feedback,accelerated results,higher overall test coverage and reduced business coverages.
7. Continuous Integration helps increase code coverage, helps deploy your code to production and build stuff faster.
