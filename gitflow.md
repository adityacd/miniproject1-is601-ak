## Understanding the Gitflow


1. Repository
* A repository is like a folder for your project.
* Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history.
* You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

2. Clone
* Clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location.
* The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote machine accessible supported protocols.
* git clone is used.
```
git clone <repositorylink>
```

3. Fork  
* It is used to access the contents of the owner repository.


4. Branch
* A branch is a reference to a commit. 
* The branch represents the top of a series of commits.


5. Commit

* It captures the snapshot of the currently made changes in git.
