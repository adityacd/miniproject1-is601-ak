# Getting friendly with Filesystems and Vi Commands



## What is a Filesystem?

* A file system stores and organizes data and can be thought of as a type of index for all the data contained in a storage device.
* Without a file system, stored information wouldn't be isolated into individual files and difficult to identify.
* As data capacities increase, the organization and accessibility of individual files are becoming even more important in data storage.

## What is vi?
* The vi editor (short for visual editor) is a screen editor which is available on almost all Unix systems. Once you have learned vi, you will find that it is a fast and powerful editor. vi has no menus but instead uses combinations of keystrokes in order to accomplish commands. 
* vi (pronounced "vee-eye") is short for "vi"sual editor. It displays a window into the file being edited that shows 24 lines of text.
* vi lets you add, change, and delete text, but does not provide such formatting capabilities as centering lines or indenting paragraphs.
