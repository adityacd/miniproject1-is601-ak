* 1. Using all of the above help in increasing the efficiency and scalability of the system.
* 2. They all help make the system more organised and systematic which makes surfing through the system much more easier.
* 3. Github being open source helps people track changes, view progress of ones software development.
* 4. Github allows collaboration amongst people sitting across different locations.
* 5. Docker helps in continuous integration efficiency, compatibility,maintainability,continuous deployment and testing.
* 6. Automated testing provides faster feedback,accelerated results,higher overall test coverage and reduced business coverages.
* 7. Continuous Integration helps increase code coverage, helps deploy your code to production and build stuff faster.
