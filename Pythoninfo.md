# Information about Python
# There are some important terminology in python which evryone needs to know, which are as follows:-

**1. How python uses indentation to control flow:-**
Python uses whitespace character or spaces as indentation tools to implement control flow. It helps our ability ability to write code   that is useful.

**2. Don’t repeat yourself:-**
DRY or don’t repeat yourself is a basic code of conduct of writing code whose aim is to reduce redundancy caused by repetition of software patterns. 

**3. Design patterns from Gang Of Four:-**
The design patterns from Gang Of Four are based on object oriented programming and can be applied to any object oriented languages like java , C++. The gang of four patterns are broken into three categories 
a)Creational design patterns
b)Structural design patterns
c)Behavioural design patterns

**4. Class:-**
A class in python is basically an object constructor or a blueprint for creating objects.

 **5. Objects:-**
Object is an element of a class, and it has the behaviour of it’s class.

**6. Static:-** 
A static is a method which is bound to a class, rather than the objects for that class. It can be called without an object.

**7. Property/Attribute:-** 
An attribute belongs to a class itself and it is shared by all instances of that class, it is defined in the class body at the top. Instance attributes are not are not shared by objects.

**8. Method:-** 
Method is a function that is available for an object due to the object’s type and it is a member of the class.

**9. Exception:-**
It is an error which python throws during the execution of a program. When the error occurs, python creates an exception that can be handled which prevents our program from crashing.

**Unit test:-** 
It is the first level of software testing in python, in which the smallest testables part of software are tested. This helps in identifying that each unit of the software functions as designed.

**Constructor:-** 
Constructor is a unique kind of method that is called by python when it instantiates an object using the definitions in class.  

**Factory:-** 
It is  a creational design pattern used for creating implementations of a common interface. It helps in separating the procedure for creating an object using code that depends on the interface of the object.
